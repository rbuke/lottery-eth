## Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ethereum-lottery
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm ci
```

3. Create a `.env` file:
```env
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_key
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```

Get coverage report:
```bash
npx hardhat coverage
```

## Development

1. 
```bash
npx hardhat compile 
npx hardhat node
```

2. Deploy the Vault Contract to the network:
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Vault.ts --network localhost
```

2. Deploy the lottery contract - Ensure the VAULT_WALLET address is updated to match the address it has been deployed to
```bash
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Lottery.ts --network localhost
```

3. Run the initialise function in the Vault smart contract to update the lottery contract address
```bash 
# e.g
 await vault.connect(owner).initialize("0xe7f1725e7734ce288f8367e1bb143e90bb3f0512");

await lottery.startNewDraw();
```

2. Users buy tickets:
```typescript
await lottery.buyTickets(numberOfTickets, {
    value: ticketPrice * numberOfTickets
});
```

3. Owner selects winner:
```typescript
await lottery.selectWinner();
```
